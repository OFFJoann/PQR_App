FORM_WITH_API

Technology: NodeJS-React-Python-FastAPI

This project involves a basic, adaptable form created using React technology. It is designed to be easy to understand and includes various data inputs and routes. Ultimately, it compiles the collected data into a JSON object, which is then sent to a backend built with Python-FastAPI. This backend accumulates the data in JSON format upon receiving it at the endpoint. Additionally, this backend can be seamlessly integrated with Store Procedium and can redirect all data to a database.
